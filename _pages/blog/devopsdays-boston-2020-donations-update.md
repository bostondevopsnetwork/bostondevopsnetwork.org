<p>Thanks to the financial support of our community and attendees, the organizers of DevOpsDays Boston were able to donate a total of $9,000 across three organizations: <a href="http://www.kodeconnect.org/">KodeConnect</a>, <a href="http://yearup.org/">YearUp</a>, and <a href="http://www.resilientcoders.org/">Resilient Coders</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, our organization has put a process in place to continue to allow us to support similar causes moving forward. This is in line with part of our broader mission to support underrepresented communities. Inclusion is vital to changing and improving the Boston DevOps scene.</p>



<p>We consider it one of our core responsibilities as organizers to encourage our community to come together to financially support other organizations that promote inclusion and equity.&nbsp; We would like to give a special thanks to this year’s “I’m feeling generous” participants who helped us raise $4,500 from participants. Based on other revenue (and some savings on budget due to DIY post-processing efforts), we were able to match that with an additional $4,500.</p>



<p>We are looking forward to future opportunities to serve the community and for others to get involved in organizing. If you are interested in volunteering, please reach out to <a href="mailto:boston@devopsdays.org">boston@devopsdays.org</a>.</p>
