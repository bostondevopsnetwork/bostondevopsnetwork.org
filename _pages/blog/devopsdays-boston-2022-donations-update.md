Thanks to the financial support of our community and attendees, the organizers of DevOpsDays Boston were able to donate a total of $30,000 across four organizations, two year-over-year and two new notable Boston charitables. This is in line with part of our broader mission to support underrepresented communities. Inclusion is vital to changing and improving the Boston DevOps scene.

* [YearUp](http://yearup.org/) - $5,000
* [Resilient Coders](http://www.resilientcoders.org/) - $5,000
* [Rosieâ€™s Place](https://www.rosiesplace.org/) - $10,000
* [Pine Street Inn](https://www.pinestreetinn.org/) - $10,000

We consider it one of our core responsibilities as organizers to encourage our community to come together to financially support other organizations that promote inclusion and equity.

We are looking forward to future opportunities to serve the community and for others to get involved in organizing. If you are interested in volunteering, please reach out to [boston@devopsdays.org](mailto:boston@devopsdays.org).
