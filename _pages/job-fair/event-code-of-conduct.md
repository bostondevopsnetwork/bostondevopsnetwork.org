<p>All participants of Boston DevOps Network events are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code. Cooperation from all participants helps ensure a safe environment for everybody.</p>



<h3>The Quick Version </h3>



<p>The Boston DevOps Network is dedicated to providing a harassment-free space for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of other users in any form. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate in any form in any forum related to our events. Users violating this code of conduct may be banned from events. </p>



<p>Embracing agility, this code of conduct may be updated to meet the needs of the community. Event participants will be notified if changes are made.</p>



<h3>The Less Quick Version </h3>



<h4>Harassment </h4>



<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; inappropriate direct messages; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. </p>



<h4>Identifying and Contacting Organizers</h4>



<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organizer if you are comfortable doing so. </p>



<p>Organizers will be easily identifiable within the event space in a way dependent on the platform (i.e. names in a different color and role for some virtual spaces, certain name tags and introductions in other spaces, etc). </p>



<h4>Behavior Outside This Space </h4>



<p>If event organizers learn of harassing or other unethical behavior outside our event spaces, we reserve the right to remove you from Boston DevOps Network events and forums. </p>



<h4>Identities </h4>



<p>Trust that people are who they say they are; do not police others’ identities. On the other side of that coin, do not impersonate identities. Do not claim to speak for a company unless you are actually legally allowed to speak on behalf of the company. Also, respect that some participants our events may wish to remain anonymous, and that’s okay. Anonymous members are also bound by this Code of Conduct. </p>



<h4>Enforcement </h4>



<p>Organizers will enforce this code of conduct. We will do everything we can to reason with the offender before banning them from the server. We reserve the right to take appropriate action, including warning and/or muting any offenders temporarily.</p>
